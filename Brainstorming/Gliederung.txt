Data Compression Explained Using Zip and PNG: A Theoretical Computer Science Perspective


1. Introduction

2.1. Information Theory in Data Compression
- understanding the limits and possibilities of data compression
- lossless compression methodes
- Entropy
- Source Coding Theorem, otherwise compression into infinity possible
- Redundancy and Mutual Information 
- Kolmogorow-Komplexität
- Schubfachprinzip
- Informationsgehalt, seltene Ereignisse enthalten mehr information als häufigere

Zip Compression: A Theoretical Perspective
- what is zip
- on what data is it used on
- why/ functionality
- how does it work
3.1. DEFLATE Algorithm:
The DEFLATE algorithm employed by the Zip format combines LZ77 (Lempel-Ziv 1977) and Huffman coding.

- Algorithmic Complexity (maybe)

- What is the difference of text/ file date to image
- difference in given data structure
- bad to exploit redundancy in images only with LZ77 and Huffman
- idea behind png: apply filters to original image to increase redundancy that can be exploited
- what filters, how do they work

Resume:
- data compression is a complexe field, theoretical limits, but the main focus is to exploit as much 
as possible of given application field (e.g. text, image, sound, ...)
